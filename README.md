⚠️ Experimental: This software is in early development. Expect frequent changes and unresolved issues.

This repo provides Terraform modules that you can use to provision a cluster of XMTP nodes (`xmtpd`) locally or on a cloud platform, such as AWS or GCP.

`xmtpd` (XMTP daemon) is an experimental version of XMTP node software. It is **not** the node software that currently forms the XMTP network.

To learn more about `xmtpd`, see the [`xmtpd` repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd).
